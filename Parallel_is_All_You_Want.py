# Parallel is All You Want: Combining Spatial and Temporal Feature Representions of Speech Emotion by Parallelizing CNNs and Transformer-Encoders
# Abstract
In this notebook, I'm going to build upon my [Intro to Speech Audio Classification repo](https://github.com/IliaZenkov/sklearn-audio-classification) and build two parallel convolutional neural networks (CNN) in parallel with a Transformer encoder network to classify audio data. We're working on the [RAVDESS dataset](https://smartlaboratory.org/ravdess/) to classify emotions from one of 8 classes. We combine the CNN for spatial feature representation and the Transformer for temporal feature representation. We augment the training data by increasing variation in the dataset to reduce overfitting; we use Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) to augment the RAVDESS dataset three-fold for a total of 4320 audio samples.

We harness the image-classification and spatial feature representation power of the CNN by treating MFCC plots as grayscale images; their width is a time scale, their height is a frequency scale. The value of each pixel in the MFCC is the intensity of the audio signal at a particular range of mel frequencies at a time step. 

Because of the sequential nature of the data, we will also use the Transformer to try and model as accurately as possible the temporal relationships between pitch transitions in emotions.  

This notebook takes inspirations from a variety of recent advances in deep learning and network architectures; in particular, stacked and parallel CNN networks combined with multi-head self-attention layers from the Transformer Encoder. I hypothesize that the expansion of CNN filter channel dimensions and reduction of feature maps will provide the most expressive feature representation at the lowest computational cost, while the Transformer-Encoder is used with the hypothesis that the network will learn to predict frequency distributions of different emotions according to the global structure of the MFCC plot (and indirectly, mel spectrogram) of each emotion. **With the strength of the CNN in spatial feature representation and Transformer in sequence encoding, I manage to achieve a 97% accuracy on a hold-out set from the RAVDESS dataset.**

# Introduction
From my previous notebook: "Long-Short-Term-Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are excellent DNN candidates for audio data classification: LSTM RNNs because of their excellent ability to interpret sequential data such as features of the audio waveform represented as a time series; CNNs because features engineered on audio data such as spectrograms have marked resemblance to images, in which CNNs excel at recognizing and discriminating between distinct patterns." - Me 

I'm going to build on that - CNNs are still the hallmark of image classification today, although even in this domain Transformers are beginning to take the main stage: A [2021 ICLR submission: An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://openreview.net/forum?id=YicbFdNTTy) claims they've implemented a Transformer for image classification that outperforms a state of the art CNN, and at a much lower computational complexity.

In addition to taking inspiration from the above, it's also no longer 2015 - so instead of the LSTM-RNN I'm going to implement its successor the Transformer model in parallel with a CNN to try and get state-of-the-art performance on the RAVDESS dataset. 

Other motivations for the architecture of this model come from a variety of papers from the past few years. **The most notable inspirations are:**
- The Transformer: [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) for the Transformer
- Inception and GoogLeNet: [Going Deeper with Convolutions](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43022.pdf) for parallel, stacked CNNs
- AlexNet: [ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional
](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) for increasing the complexity of feature maps with deeper CNN networks, as well as data augmentation by adding modified versions of the training data to itself
- VGGNet: [Very Deep Convolutional Networks For Large-Scale Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf) for using fixed size kernels throughout stacked CNN layers
- LeNet: [Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf) for the convolution>pool>convolution>pool paradigm
- Self-Attention: [Long Short-Term Memory-Networks for Machine Reading](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06733.pdf) for understanding Transformer architecture
- Dropout regularization: [Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from
Overfitting](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/JMLRdropout.pdf) speaks for itself
- Batch Norm: [Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167) speaks for itself

Let's get to it.

Define features as in the previous notebook on this task from my ['sklearn-audio-classification' repo](https://github.com/IliaZenkov/sklearn-audio-classification). That notebook explains the motivation behind the Mel Spectrogram and its derivative MFCC, which we use as a feature. In short, we're looking for transitions in audible pitch frequencies. 

**MFCCs alone provide the best accuracy in this model with training considerations in mind - and provide as good an accuracy as using chromagrams + mel spectrograms + MFCCs. We don't want extra complexity in a highly parameterized deep neural net such as this one** (unless we absolutely need it).

"""## Augmenting the Data with AWGN - Additive White Gaussian Noise

### Motivation

Since our dataset is small, it is prone to overfitting - especially with highly parameterized deep neural net models
such as the one we aim to build in this notebook. As such, we're going to want to augment our data. Generating more real samples will be immensely difficult. Instead, we can add white noise to the audio signals - not only to mask the effect of random noise present in the training set - but also **to create pseudo-new training samples and offset the impact of noise intrinsic to the dataset.** 

In addition, the RAVDESS dataset is extremely clean - we will likely want to make predictions on noisy, real-world data - yet another reason to augment the training data.

We're going to use Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). It's Additive because we're adding it to the source audio signal,
**it's Gaussian because the noise vector will be sampled from a normal distribution and have a time average of zero (zero-mean), and it's white because after a whitening transformation the noise will add power to the audio signal uniformly across the frequency distribution.**

We need a good balance of noise - too little will be useless, and too much will make it too difficult for the network to learn from the training data. **Note that this is just for training - we would _not_ need to add AWGN to real-world data on which we make predictions** (although we could). 

### Math
The key parameters in AWGN are the signal to noise ratio (SNR), defining the magnitude of the noise added w.r.t. the audio signal. We parameterize AWGN with the minimum and maximize SNR so we can pick a random SNR to use in augmenting each sample's waveform.

We need to constrain covariance to make it true AWGN. **We make a zero-mean vector of Gaussian noises (np.random.normal) that are statistically dependent. We need to apply a [whitening transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitening_transformation)**, a linear transformation taking a vector of random normal (Gaussian) variables with a known covariance matrix and mapping it to a new vector whose covariance is the identity matrix, i.e. the vector is now perfectly uncorrelated with a diaganol covariance matrix, each point of noise having variance == stdev == 1. **The whitening transformation by definition transforms a vector into a white noise vector.**

We're going to add the AWGN augmented waveforms as new samples to our dataset. **Since we generate AWGN which is random for each and every sample - random random noise - we can add multiples of our noise-augmented dataset. I'll add 2 extra identical, randomly noisy datasets with 1440 samples each to get a dataset with 1440 native + 1440x2 == 4320 noisy samples.**

Scaling will drastically decrease the length of time the model needs to train to convergence - it will have easier computations to perform on smaller magnitudes. **For reference, scaling reduces the time to convergence from about 500 to 200 epochs for this model.**

# Architecture Overview
<img src="reports/cnn-transformer-final.png">
As a whole, the CNN architecture of this network is inspired by a combination of the golden standards in image and sequence processing over the last few years.

Each 3-layer deep 2D convolutional block is extremely similar to the **classic [LeNet](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf) architecture: Conv->Pool>Conv>Pool>FC.** 

**[AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) forms the basis for increasing the complexity of feature maps with channel expansion through stacked CNN layers; [Inception and GoogLeNet](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43022.pdf) are the inspiration for parallelizing CNN layers in the hopes of diverisfying the features learned by the network.** 

**[VGGNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf) proved the unreasonable efficiency of using fixed sized kernels throughout deeply stacked CNN layers;** I found this to extend to this task. Specifically, VGG saw an improvement over AlexNet largely by replacing large kernels (i.e. 11x11 stride 5) with smaller ones of 3x3 stride 1. One of the motivations that VGG cites for this is that the 3x3 kernel is the smallest kernel size choice in understanding spatial data w.r.t. up/down/left/right (although VGG also uses 1x1 kernels). VGGNet also inspires the maxpool kernel size of 2x2 stride 2, as I have used at the first layer of each convolutional block. 

To be more precise, the motivation to use small stacked filters is two-fold: Computational efficiency and expressivity of feature representation. When we stack 3 3x3 kernels on top of eachother as in this architecture, the second layer has a 5x5 view of the original input volume, and the 3rd layer a 7x7 view. However, the nonlinearities between each smaller layer convey more complex feature representations, whereas a single 7x7 layer would only perform a linear transformation itself. Furthermore, if we keep channel (C) consistent between layers, then 3 3x3 kernels are parameterized by (3(C(3x3xC)) = 27C^2 parameters, while just one 7x7 kernel needs C(7x7xC) = 49C^2 parameters. **Ultimately, small stacked kernels appear to be both more powerful and efficient - although, in [Large Kernel Matters -
Improve Semantic Segmentation by Global Convolutional Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.02719.pdf), the authors conclude that a larger kernel outperforms smaller stacked kernels for semantic segmentation - however, since we are just doing the semantic part (classification) and don't care about "where" the emotion is - this shouldn't apply.**

Finally, the original [2015 Batch Normalization (BN) paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167) suggests that "We add the BN transform immediately before the nonlinearity" i.e. before ReLU; however, **I achieved better performance out of this architechture using BN after ReLU. See Keras author's [Francois Chollet's response on GitHub](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/1802#issuecomment-187966878) regarding the BN order issue: "I can guarantee that recent code written by Christian \[Szegedy\] applies relu before BN".** 

The Transformer architecture is precisely as in Viswani et al, 2017: Attention is All You Need, but I use 4 stacked encoders instead of 6 as in their paper. For more details on the Transformer block: [Appendix B: The Transformer and Self-Attention (is All You Need)](#Appendix-B:-The-Transformer-and-Self-Attention-(is-All-You-Need))

# CNN Motivation
**CNNs with 2D convolutional layers are the gold standard for image processing**, other than the recent advances in the Transformer for images. 2D convolution layers accept input feature maps in a (N,C,H,W) (batch size, channel, height, width) format. We have 4320 mels - 1440 native and 2880 noise augmented - each mel is of shape 128x563 representing 128 mel frequency bands with 563 timesteps each. **We can imagine MFCC plots to be a black and white image with 1 signal intensity channel.** Our MFCC input feature tensor will thus be of shape (4320, 1, 128, 563). I'm going to refer to input/output feature maps and input/output volumes interchangeably, but they have the same meaning. After an activation function operates on a feature map, it produces an activation map.

I'm using 3x3 kernels in all 3 layers in both CNN blocks. The first layer only has a single input channel creating a 1x3x3 filter. The next layer has 16 input channels and 32 output channels , producing 32 unique 16x3x3 filters, *each* filter having 16x3x3 = 144 weights. The second layer is applying 32 differently weighted 16x3x3 filters to an input volume of 16x64x281 (the 2x2 maxpooled output of the first layer), producing an output feature map of 32x8x35 after 8x8 stride 8 maxpooling. The last layer has 32 input channels, so a 32x3x3 filter, and 64 output channels, so 64 unique such filters. The last layer produces an output feature map of 64x1x4 after 8x8 stride 4 maxpooling. **In sum, I hope that the expansion of filter dimensions and reduction of feature maps provides the most expressive feature representation at the lowest computational cost.** 

**The key motivations and operations of a 2D Convolutional Neural Net are described in detail in [Appendix A: Convolutional Neural Nets Dissected](#Appendix-A:-Convolutional-Neural-Nets-Dissected) in order to explain the motivation behind the necessity of the CNN for this task and the considerations to take when optimizing the hyperparameters of each layer in a CNN.**

# Transformer-Encoder Motivation

**I use the Transformer-Encoder layer as introduced in [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) with the hopes that the network will learn to predict frequency distributions of different emotions according to the global structure of the MFCCs of each emotion.** I could have used LSTM-RNNs to learn the sequence of the spectrogram for each emotion, but the network would only learn to predict frequency changes according to adjacent time steps; in contrast, the multi-head self-attention layers of the transformer enable the network to look at multiple previous time steps when predicting the next. This made sense to me because emotions colour the entire sequence of frequencies, not just at one timestep. 

**I maxpool the input MFCC map to the transformer block to drastically reduce the number of parameters the network needs to learn.**

**The key motivations and operations behind the Transformer architecture are described in detail in [Appendix B: The Transformer](#Appendix-B:-The-Transformer)**

"""## Analyzing The Flow of Tensors Through the Network
We zero-pad 1 the input feature map to each convolutional layer to get back from the layer the same shape tensor as we input: zero-pad 1 adds 2 to each of (H, W) dims, and the 3x3, stride 1 kernels cuts off (kernel - stride == 2) dims from each of (H,W). **Zero-pad 1 --> 3x3 stride 1 kernel effectively throws away the zero pads to get same input/output shape from each conv2D block.**

At the end of first convolutional layer in each block we have a maxpool kernel of size 2x2, stride 2 which will take 1 of 4 pixels in its winddow. For the input feature map the maxpool kernel will progress 128/2 = 64 times over the rows and 563/2=281 times over the columns. **Nonoverlapping maxpool kernel reduces each output dim to input dim/kernel size.** We then expand the output channels to 16 making an output feature map of (16x64x281). 

The next two convolutional layers in each block have a maxpool kernel size 8x8, stride 8. Same math as above, maxpool reduces each dim/8. 2nd conv layer takes (16x64x281) --> (32x8x35). 3rd and final conv layer takes (32x8x35) --> (64x1x4).

**Note that in (N,C,H,W) format, for MFCCs H = MFCC (pitch),  W = time step.**

**Complete flow through each convolutional block (C,H,W):**

    “We observe that the solutions found by adaptive methods generalize worse (often significantly worse) than SGD, even 
    when these solutions have better training performance. These results suggest that practitioners should reconsider the

Build the complete training loop using the training and validation step functions. 

This model is not reasonable to train on CPU, but it's a good way to check if the model compiled successfully. I'm using Google Colab's free GPU (K80 - 24GB RAM ~2.9 TFLOPs). This model is pretty big (383,688 params to learn if I've checked the math correctly) but trains to convergence within ~10 minutes on a K80.

Pick the number of epochs (complete pass of all training samples) to use that is higher than reasonable so the model does not terminate just before convergence - I manually stopped it when it converges.

    let friends use minibatches larger than 32. Let's face it: the only people have switched to minibatch sizes larger than one since 2012 is because GPUs are inefficient for batch sizes smaller than 32. That's a terrible reason. It just means our hardware sucks."

For some reference points: [A May 2020 paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1746809420300501) claims to have achieved a "new SOTA" on RAVDESS with 71.61% accuracy on 8 emotions, while [another May 2020 paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9122698) claims to have achieved the "new SOTA" with an 90% F1 score on 8 emotions. Both use CNN architechtures. However, the paper reporting 90% F1 score is inflated by testing on training samples: [See the GitHub issue on this paper.](https://github.com/marcogdepinto/emotion-classification-from-audio-files/issues/11)

From the author with a 90% score: _"Also, the previous versions of this work used audio features extracted from the videos of the RAVDESS dataset. This particular part of the pipeline has been removed because it was shuffling very similar files in the training and test sets, boosting accuracy of the model as a consequence (overfitting)."_ 

The author has augmented the RAVDESS speech audio dataset with speech extracted from video data from RAVDESS - so the training data contained duplicate samples *before being split into training and test sets.* For reference, I achieved a 97% accuracy with this model when I similarly augmented the dataset with duplicate speech audio before splitting data. I corrected this issue by augmenting data *only after splitting into train/validation/test sets.*

This is an excellent example of "if it's too good to be true". More conservative estimates are more likely to be reproducible, in my opinion.

"""Unsurprising results - the model has trouble differentiating between 'neutral' and 'calm', and between 'disgust' and 'angry'. 

If a human were asked to differentiate disgust and anger, getting 49/60 correct and 11/60 wrong wouldn't be too bad. 

Other predictable results include confusion of 'sad' for 'disgust'. It perhaps surprising that 'fearful' is confused for 'happy' as often as it is for 'sad' or 'disgust' - although fear is indeed a multifaceted emotion. 

Based on this, I would compare in finer detail the features of confused emotions and see if there are any differences at all - and how to capture them. For real-world data, it would be much more productive to perform sentiment analysis on the spoken words translated to text, and consider that in our final evaluation.

# Conclusion
---------------
Advances of the last 5 years involving upgrades to the autoencoder scheme have lead to the RNN, the upgraded LSTM-RNN, bidirectional LSTM-RNNs, and eventually to LSTM-RNNs with Attention layers to give profound temporal expressivity to the latent space of sequentially encoded data. The Transformer has built on this by taking advantage of parallelized self-attention layers to provide an almost truly global temporal representation of sequential data. 

Today, carefully thought out architecture building on these blocks leads to reasonable training times and excellent generalizability. We combine the CNN for spatial feature representation and the Transformer for temporal feature representation, and  augment the training data by increasing variation in the training dataset to reduce overfitting.

CNNs are still the standard for encoding representations of spatial data. A CNN's filters' kernel sizes are important to both performance and accuracy, especially considering recent paradigms using smaller maxpool kernels such as those of the 3x3 strided 1 kernels in [VGGNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf), in contrast to the 11x11 stride 4 kernels as in the [AlexNet paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf).

When we added convolutional and transformer layers beyond what was used here, that actually decreased test accuracy. Only as much complexity is warranted as is needed for generalizability. Although CNNs are good for images and transformers for sequential data, recently emerging paradigms (such as in this notebook) show that these networks are perfectly cross-applicable given careful thought. 

CNNs are powerful. Transformers work beautifully. They're even better together. Gone are the days of the LSTM-RNN.

If you got this far, I sincerely appreciate your taking the time to do so. Feel free to drop me a line at ilzenkov@gmail.com with any feedback or questions you may have.
